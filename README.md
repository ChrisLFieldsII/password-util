 # Password Util
Generate random passwords and store them in a vault for later access.

# Developed with:
1. React/Redux
2. Node/Express
3. MongoDB
4. GraphQL
5. CSS Grid

# Motivation
 If only we humans could remember every single username/password for every account we've ever made!
 I store all of my login info in a Notepad app on my cell phone so I decided to make a personal site that
 would do the same but with added functionality.

 I had already made an app like this in Java but wanted to
 get practice with some newer technologies.

 # Things I Learned:
 1. Using GraphQL instead of REST
 2. Using Redux for app state management
 3. Using CSS Grid for a responsive design

 # TO DO:
 1. Cryptographically generate random numbers for password
 2. Finish Vault
